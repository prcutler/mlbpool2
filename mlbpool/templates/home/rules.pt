        <h1>Rules</h1>
            <p>Before the Major League Baseball season starts, you will make the following picks for the season:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Division winners, 2nd place and last place for all three divisions in both the American League
                    and National League. (18 picks)</li>
                <li>Wild Card winners (2) from the AL and NL.  (4 picks)</li>
                <li>Team with the most wins in each league.  (2 picks)</li>
                <li>Team with the most losses in each league (2 picks)</li>
                <li>Individual hitting leaders in batting average, RBIs, and home runs for both the
                    AL and NL. (6 picks)</li>
                <li>Individual pitching leaders in ERA and saves in both the AL and NL. (4 picks)</li>
                <li>Tiebreaker: How many wins will the Minnesota Twins finish with? (1 pick)</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Changing your picks</h3>
                <p>Before the season starts, you can change your picks as many times as you want without any
                penalty.</p>
                <p>During the All-Star break starting Sunday night at 7pm EST until Thursday at 7pm EST following the
                    All-Star game, you can change up to 14 picks, except the tiebreaker pick.
                    These picks will be worth half of the original points.
                    Unique points are still worth double.</p>
                <p>You can only change your picks <b>once</b> during the All-Star break.</p>
            <h3>Individual Leaders</h3>
                <p> These are staggered to improve the odds of earning points.
                    For example, you earn 30 points for the player with the most home runs.
                    If he is second in home runs, you earn 20 points.
                    If he is third, you get 10 points.  You will choose an individual leader in each category for
                    both leagues (AL and NL).</p>
                <p>
                    For batting average and ERA, MLBPool2 uses the same rules as Major League Baseball.  A MLB player
                    only
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average#Qualifications_for_the_batting_title">qualifies
                    for the batting average title</a> when he averages 3.1 plate appearances per team game.
                    A pitcher must average throwing at least one inning per game scheduled for his team during the
                    season (currently 162 innings per 162 games) to
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_annual_ERA_leaders#endnote_Qualifyc">
                        qualify for the ERA title.</a>.  (So don't pick a relief pitcher for ERA!)
                </p>
            <h3>Double Points Bonus</h3>
                <p> If two or less players make the same pick, you will be eligible for
                    double points in that category, also known as a "unique pick".
                    For instance, if you are one of two players to pick Bryce Harper
                    for home runs, and he ends up in the top three, you would earn 60 points instead of 30
                    (if he ends in 1st place), 40 instead of 20 (2nd place), or 20 instead of 10 (3rd place)
                    <b>if no one else or only one other MLBPool has chosen him</b>.
                    This applies to all individual picks and you can
                    earn points (and double points if you are the only one of two to pick that player) if the player
                    you choose finishes in first, second or third.  Team picks, such as the division winners,
                    best record, or wildcard picks are not eligible for the double points bonus.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you and other MLBPool2 players have the same pick at the beginning of the season
                    and all but one player changes that pick at the All-Star break, the original pick does not
                    qualify for the double points bonus.</p>
                    <p>You can view your picks from your <a href="/account">account page</a> and there
                    is a column that shows if your pick is unique.  This is updated after the season starts and
                    after the All-Star break ends.  Your unique picks could change at the All-Star break if
                        you change a pick and another player does as well.  If you had a unique pick at the
                        start of the season and a player changes their pick at the All-Star Break to the player
                        that you have as unique, <b>you keep your double points bonus</b>. </p>

            <h2>Points Breakdown:</h2>

            <h3>Division picks</h3>
                <p>For each division in the two leagues (American and National), pick which teams will come in
                first, second and last place.  If you pick the Boston Red Sox to come in first,
                    and they finish first, you earn 50 points. You <strong>can</strong> pick
                    the same team multiple times.  You could pick the Red Sox to finish first
                    and second to hedge your bet.  Three divisions of three picks each:</p>

            <h3>2019 Season Changes</h3>
                <p>The 2019 season changed Pitcher Wins to Pitcher Saves.  Too many relief pitchers qualify for wins,
                    making this selection difficult.  Saves adds a relief pitcher to the scoring, giving MLBPool2
                    players better choices in choosing starting pitchers for ERA versus relief pitchers for Saves.

            <h3>Fees and Payouts</h3>
                <p>The entry fee is $100.  Payouts will be determined by the number of players and 100%
                     of the fees (minus a small amount to cover web hosting and MLB statistics) are paid to
                    the league players.</p>
